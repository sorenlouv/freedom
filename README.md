Freedom Calendar is a service to sync your Facebook events to your calendar of choice, with only two clicks - and with the added benefit of removing spammy, unwanted events.

If you are like me, you have been overloaded by annoying events from people you are connected with on Facebook. These events find their way into the calendar on your phone and computer, before you can click "Unattend!!".

This service will filter your events, so only the events you have responded "Attending", or "Maybe attending" will show up.
